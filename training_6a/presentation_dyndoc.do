 # Dynamic Documents with Jupyter Notebooks 

 ## Before We Begin
 
 - Special thanks to Oscar Barriga Cabanillas for helping out today
 - Thank you for BITSS for organizing 
 - How has it been so far?
 - A Question: 
     - How familiar are you with python? Jupyter?
     - What are you thinking of getting out of this talk?
     

 ## How to watch this presentation:
 - Either:
     - `git clone` the repository
     - Start up jupyter lab
     - open `presentation.ipynb`
     - follow along
 - Or:
     - Go to the repository and press the `Launch Binder` Button
     - To be explained later.
     

 ## Why Dynamic Documents?
 
 Dynamic Documents are a part of the bigger picture of Reproducible Science. Sure, there is a fixed cost; BUT, they make my life easier in these ways:
 
 - Short term: Easier to document fresh out of the oven results
 - Medium term: Fast, reliable and tractable new results
 - Long term: You can see how everything was created
 

 ## What are Dynamic Documents?
 
 Based on principles of literate programming, we aim at combining code and paper in one single document
 
 - Best framework to achieve the holy grail of one-click reproducible workflow
 - Best two current implementations: RMarkdown (R) & Jupyter (Python).
 - Stata is catching up: We will come back to this in a second
 

 ## The State of Things Now
 
 Currently, the code and the narrative components live in separate universes

 ## Part of Larger Workflow
 
 - Dynamic documents are best used as part of a larger organized workflow
     - Structuring folders: Data, analysis, output
     - Documenting code
     - Combining both into a final document: Pre analysis or final paper
 

 ## Markdown's Entrance
 
 - In terms of writing the "paper"/documentation part of dynamic documents, there are many solutions
     - Latex, HTML, RST (ReStructured Text)
 - But most have honed in on using Markdown
     - Markdown is an easy way to write formatted text in a plain text format
     - But without as verbose and difficult of a syntax like latex/HTML
 - Although basic markdown has the basics for formatting, creating tables, adding figures
 - We will use Pandoc, which is used in both the Stata and R sessions

 ## Markdown Cheatsheet
 
 There are loads of markdown cheatsheats on the web. One can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

 ## Headings
 
 ```

 ## Math
 
 We assume that comparative advantage is $\alpha$ and $\alpha = \beta + \gamma$
 
 ```
 We assume that comparative advantage is $\alpha$ and $\alpha = \beta + \gamma$
 ```

 $$\begin{aligned}
 y_{it} = X_{it}\beta + \varepsilon_{it} \\
 X_{it}  = Z_{it}\gamma + \nu_{it}
 \end{aligned}$$
 
 ```
 $$\begin{aligned}
 y_{it} = X_{it}\beta + \varepsilon_{it} \\
 X_{it}  = Z_{it}\gamma + \nu_{it}
 \end{aligned}$$
 ```

 ## What is Pandoc?
 
 - Pandoc is sort of what it says: pan (all), doc (document)
 - It's a way to convert between and across different file formats
     - Word -> HTML
     - Latex -> Markdown
     - HTML -> XML
     - Anything to anything
 - See Pandoc's [website](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options) for all input and output filetypes

 ## The Magic of Pandoc
 
 - Pandoc and Markdown allows you to create one file that can then be used in many different places
 - Example:
     - You're writing your CV and want to put it up in various places.
     - Your website needs HTML
     - One job posting allows PDF
     - One job posting only allows Word
 - Ordinarily, you would need to have three versions, Word, HTML, PDF
     - This might get unruly as you change one but forget to change the other
     - What if there's another file format you might need?
 - With Pandoc and markdown, you would:
     - write your CV in markdown
     - convert to PDF, Word and PDF with pandoc

 ## What are Jupyter Notebooks?
 
 - A way to do literate programming and dynamic documents 
 - Provide code and writing/analysis, on a language agnostic platform
     - Meaning that it is not restricted to just one language
     - Currently there are so-called kernels for many languages
     - Including Stata, Python, R, C, Golang, C++, Fortran and more coming!
 - Uses the power of Markdown/Latex Math and Code to tell a story and provide an efficient workflow
 - Convert into several different formats including Latex, HTML, Presentations etc...
 - The Jupyter server is also available in other text editors such as Atom and VS Code.
 - And now available in STATA!

 ## Under the Hood
 
 - You can think of Jupyter as broadly being made up of two parts:
     - A JSON document that organizes text between markdown, code, figures, widgets, etc...
     - A server that loads a "kernel" with a particular language and knows how to translate the markdown to formatted text and the code to execution
     - A web interface (although not required)

 ## Why Jupyter Notebooks?
 
 - Jupyter is ubiquitous
 - Jupyter is used by basically all of the data science community
 - Jupyter is used by other software (VS Code, Atom/Hydrogen)
 - Since Jupyter is a JSON document and built using web tools, anything that uses webtools can use it 
 - Science and publishing is changing (PDFs are becoming old, open access and web journals are becoming more popular)
     - Present results in a dynamic way
     - Interactive
     - More efficient to show quick interactive widget to experiment with colleagues/advisors than 50 figures in a static PDF

 ## Extensions
 
 JupyterLab (the web interface) comes with many extensions for anything you might want:
 
 - A language server
 - multicursor support 
 - git integration
 - and more...

 ## Running Code



<<dd_do>>
set obs 10

gen x = runiform()
gen treat = x > .2
gen y = runiform()
<</dd_do>>




 ## Figures



<<dd_do>>
twoway scatter y x
<</dd_do>>
<<dd_graph: saving("graph.svg") alt("scatter y x") replace height(400)>>




 ## Kernel Magics
 
 - Many Jupyter kernels have something called magics
     - A way to make certain actions easy without having to write too much code
     - Often language specific
 - All Stata magics can be found [here](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/using_stata_kernel/magics/)

 ## Exporting

 - Exporting to HTML, PDF and slides is possible through the menu: File -> Export Notebook as -> PDF

 ## Binder and Hosting Notebooks
 
 - Jupyter is great and all, but what if you advisor/boss doesn't have Jupyter installed?
 - What if they do, but they don't have all the dependencies needed for your cool dashboard?
 - That's where binder comes in
 - Binder uses `docker` to create a containerized version of your notebook with all dependencies installed and anyone can access it even if they don't have jupyter installed at all. 
 - They just need a web browser
 - We've already seen how this works, either with the dashboard or with this very presentation!
 - All you need is a public github repository and notebook in that repository and that's it!
 - Waiting time for spinning up the notebook will vary
 - While it's spinning it up, any questions so far?

 ## Port-forwarding and setting up Jupyter to work on a server
 
 - Many people might have servers in their universities/organizations that are more powerful than a laptop.
 - Jupyter allows the ability to run a notebook locally (on your laptop screen), but using the power of the server.
     - This requires jupyter being installed on the server
     - This isn't a difficult thing to do for a sysadmin, so it's worth finding out whether that's possible

 ### Setting up jupyter on a server
 
 - The first thing you need to do is log on to the server and start a jupyter instance:
 
 `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888`
 
 - This tells the server to start an instance of jupyter, without a browser (we won't need it, nor can a server open up a browser window), in port 8888 (this will be important later)
 - For Mac users, you can use `ssh` to finish the process. Just type:
 `ssh username@host -L 8888:localhost:8888`
 - Which will forward your computer 8888 port, to the server's 8888 port.
 
 - For Windows, ssh also exists, but you will need to enable it.
     - head to Settings > Apps and click “Manage optional features” under Apps & features.
     - Click Add a Feature, and find OpenSSH
 - Then use the same command as for Macs:
 `ssh username@host -L 8888:localhost:8888`
 
 - Then go to your browser:
     - `localhost:8888` and you should be taken to a Jupyter page and prompted for a token. 
     - You can find this token in the window where you started Jupyter on the server
         - Copy and paste this token into the prompt, and VOILA!
 - Now you have Jupyter running on your computer's browser window, but with the power of the server!
 

 ## Taking all this to Pure Text
 
 - One drawback of jupyter (besides dependencies) is the fact that you need to install all of this and use a browser 
 - Not very good for version control
 - `Rmd` files (used with RMarkdown) are just markdown files with code cells.
     - Great for version control
     - Readble
     - Easy to share and read in its raw form
 - Can we do this with Jupyter?
     - Yes! with `jupytext`
 

 ## Shameless self-promotion
 
 - Export notebook to a do-file!
